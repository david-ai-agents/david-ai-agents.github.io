# Here is the strategic breakdown for your "AI Readiness Audit" Spreadsheet.

This spreadsheet is designed to do the selling for you. By the time a prospect fills this out, the math should vividly demonstrate that not hiring you is costing them more than your fee.

## We will divide the audit into three sections: 
* The Cost of Inefficiency, Technical Complexity, and Strategic Value.

📊 Section 1: The "Bleeding Neck" (ROI Calculator)

Goal: Prove they are losing at least $50k/year on this problem so a $15k-$30k proposal looks cheap.
### Q1. Task Frequency & Volume
"How many times per month is this specific process performed across the entire company?"
Why this matters: Automation thrives on volume. Low volume = low ROI. High volume = high ROI.

### Q2. Human Time per Instance
"On average, how many minutes does it take a human to complete one instance of this task (including switching tabs, logging in, thinking time)?"
Why this matters: Executives usually underestimate this. 5 minutes x 1000 times a month = 83 hours lost.

### Q3. Fully Burdened Hourly Cost
"What is the average hourly cost of the employee doing this task? (Salary + Overhead usually $\approx$ $40-$80/hr)."
Why this matters: This is the anchor.

**Formula to show them: (Q1 * Q2 / 60) * Q3 = Monthly Waste.**

### Q4. The "Cost of Error"
"What is the estimated financial impact of a single human error in this process (e.g., lost lead, refund, compliance fine, reputation damage)?"
Why this matters: This is the "fear" factor. If one missed email costs a $5k deal, your automation pays for itself instantly.

⚙️ Section 2: Complexity (Why Zapier Won't Work)
Goal: Prove that this is too hard for their internal team or a cheap tool, requiring an expert (You).

### Q5. The "App Stack" Count
"List all the software platforms involved in this workflow (e.g., Outlook, Salesforce, Google Sheets, Slack, PDF Parser)."
Qualification:
1-2 Apps: Too simple (Recommend Zapier/Make DIY).
3+ Apps: Perfect Client. This requires n8n data transformation.

### Q6. Cognitive Load (The AI Trigger)
"Does this task require reading unstructured text (emails, PDFs) and making a decision/judgment?"
Qualification:
No (Just copy-paste): Simple automation.
Yes: This requires AI Agents (LLMs). This justifies your premium pricing.

### Q7. Data Stability
"Is the data for this process structured (databases/Excel) or unstructured (emails/phone calls/PDFs)?"
Why this matters: Unstructured data is the hardest problem to solve and the highest value service you offer.

🚦 Section 3: Readiness (The "Nightmare Client" Filter)
Goal: Ensure they can actually buy and won't drag out the project.

### Q8. Process Documentation
"Is there a current Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) or Loom video documenting this process step-by-step?"
The Filter:
Yes: Ready to build.
No: You must sell them a "Discovery & Mapping Workshop" ($2k-$5k) before building the agent.

### Q9. Authorization Level
"Do you own the budget and admin permissions for the software tools involved?"
Why this matters: If they say "No, IT controls everything," you are entering a slow procurement cycle (Red Flag).

🖼️ Visualizing the Output
To make this "course" feel high-value, the spreadsheet should have a "Dashboard" tab that auto-calculates their score.
💡 The "Magic Score" Logic
At the bottom of the spreadsheet, program a simple conditional formatting logic:
Result A (Low Value): "Annual Waste < $10k" -> Advice: DIY this with ChatGPT.
Result B (The Perfect Lead): "Annual Waste > $40k + Requires Decision Making" -> Advice: "Urgent: You are losing $3k/month. This requires an AI Agent. Book your Strategy Call below."Next Step: I can write the specific script for the "Video 2: The Audit Walkthrough" lesson, ensuring you sound like a high-level consultant while explaining these questions.
